# 🔐 Play "Encrypted" YouTube Videos

**Just a fun side project.**  
This browser extension lets you watch YouTube videos that were *visually encrypted* using a shader offset. It’s not practical. It’s not secure. It’s just... cursed and cool.

👉 [**Install on Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unsafeyt/)

## 🧪 How it Works

A shader adds an offset to the current **UV** of each texel.  
That's it. No DRM, no decoding — just some visual trickery with WebGL.
