# Play "Encrypted" videos from youtube
Just a fun project lmao.
To use it, open the extensions tab, enable the developer mode, unpack the zip, and add the extension. done, but there's no toggle, so every other video will be messed up, don't forget to disable it :)

Also, if you want to support the project, i have a patreon :)
