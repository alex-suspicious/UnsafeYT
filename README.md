# Play "Encrypted" videos from youtube
Just a fun project lmao.
To use it, open the extensions tab, enable the developer mode, unpack the zip, and add the extension. done, but there's no toggle, so every other video will be messed up, don't forget to disable it :)
I will publish the script for "Encrypting" later, if you know how to code, just apply the shader that adds an offset from the /textures/offset_map.png to the current UV of texel, that's it.
